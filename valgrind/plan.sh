# From README_MAINTAINERS:
#
# > -- Don't strip the debug info off lib/valgrind/$platform/vgpreload*.so
# >  in the installation tree.  Either Valgrind won't work at all, or it
# >  will still work if you do, but will generate less helpful error
# >  messages.
#
# and
#
# > -- Don't strip symbols from lib/valgrind/* in the installation tree.
# >  Doing so will likely cause problems.  Removing the line number info is
# >  probably OK (at least for some of the files in that directory), although
# >  that has not been tested by the Valgrind developers.
#
# We also shouldn't stripping ld.so:
#
# > -- Do not ship your Linux distro with a completely stripped
# >  /lib/ld.so.  At least leave the debugging symbol names on -- line
# >  number info isn't necessary.
#
# The current version in the depot isn't stripped, but that will
# likely change in the future if it is rebuilt with a newer version of
# hab.
