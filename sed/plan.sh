pkg_description="\
sed (stream editor) is a non-interactive command-line text editor. sed is \
commonly used to filter text, i.e., it takes text input, performs some \
operation (or set of operations) on it, and outputs the modified text. sed is \
typically used for extracting part of a file using pattern matching or \
substituting multiple occurrences of a string within a file.\
