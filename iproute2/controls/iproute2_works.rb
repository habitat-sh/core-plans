  title 'Ensure iproute2 works as expected'
  desc '
  Verify iproute2 by ensuring that
  (1) its installation directory exists 
  (2) all binaries return expected output.  NOTE: the version DOES NOT
  correspond to the one obtained from the executables and no clear map was 
  discovered.  For example, the current version is 4.16.0 but the version returned
  by the binaries is something like iproute2-ss180402.  The closest info found that
  maps these version was found here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17151777.  
  No version checking is therefore done in these tests
