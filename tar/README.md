To add core/tar as a depdendency, you can add one of the following to your plan file.

##### Buildtime Dependency

> pkg_build_deps=(core/tar)

##### Runtime Depdendency

> pkg_deps=(core/tar)

Usage: tar [OPTION...] [FILE]...
GNU 'tar' saves many files together into a single tape or disk archive, and can
restore individual files from the archive.

Examples:
  tar -cf archive.tar foo bar  # Create archive.tar from files foo and bar.
  tar -tvf archive.tar         # List all files in archive.tar verbosely.
  tar -xf archive.tar          # Extract all files from archive.tar.
...
```

#### Notes

##### Known issues
* Running DO_CHECK may show one test (`listed04.at`) failing on some computers - particularly on OSX laptops. Ref: https://github.com/habitat-sh/core-plans/issues/1636
