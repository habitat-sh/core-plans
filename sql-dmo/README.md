## Maintainers

The Habitat Maintainers humans@habitat.sh

## Type of Package

A Binary package containing the sql-dmo COM component

## Usage

Consuming applications will need to register the `sqldmo.dll` with the COM registry in their `init` hook:

```
."$env:SystemRoot\SysWow64\regsvr32.exe" /s "{{pkgPathFor "core/sql-dmo"}}\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\80\Tools\Binn\sqldmo.dll"
```

**Note:** If you have set the `HAB_FEAT_INSTALL_HOOK` environment variable, then the `install` hook packaged with this plan should automatically register the COM entries upon installation.
