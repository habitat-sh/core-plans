# Habitat Gradle Scaffolding

Gradle Scaffolding is a Habitat package which helps you build your [Gradle][gradle]-based **web applications**, **services**, and **processes** (hereafter referred to as "apps") into a package which runs consistently on a wide range of containers, virtual machines, or servers via the Habitat Supervisor. The Supervisor will facilitate clustering, discovery of external services such as databases, dynamically update configuration and credentials, coordinate reliable rolling updates, and a lot more!
