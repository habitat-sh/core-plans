[Habitat Plans](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/concepts-plans/) are packages in the Habitat Core Origin. They are maintained and built by the core maintainers to provide the fundamental base tier of packages used by the [Habitat](https://www.habitat.sh/) ecosystem.

Participation in the Habitat community is governed by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

You can browse all available packages that you can leverage and use, including packages built and maintained by community members both inside and outside of this core origin, in [Habitat Builder](https://bldr.habitat.sh/#/explore).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information about how to contribute to this project. Keep in mind that a core plan must by definition be abstracted to serve a wide array of users in service of their applications. If you are building a plan that is tailor made for your own unique application or specific use case, it is better suited to your own origin. If you think it would still be useful for a subset of other people, you can make it public in your own origin too. Community and external project owned origins are an awesome way to make, share, and use functionality that lives outside of and extends core plans.

The code for the core components of Habitat itself is in the [habitat-sh/habitat](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/) GitHub repository.

See [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) for a list of core plans maintainers.
