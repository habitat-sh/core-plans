# Habitat Package: Crate
Endocode Habitat Maintainers <habitat@endocode.com>

## Description

- [www](https://crate.io)
- [Docs](https://crate.io/docs/reference/)

> CrateDB combines SQL and search in a way thatâ€™s simple to scale.

CrateDB is an open source SQL database with a ground-breaking distributed design:

- Uses SQL to process any type of data, structured or unstructured;
- Performs distributed SQL queries at realtime speed, even JOINs and aggregates;
- Makes scaling simple

## Usage

- On the first node: 

```
hab sup start endocode/crate --topology leader
```

- On subsequent nodes: 

```
hab sup start endocode/crate --topology leader --peer <first node ip>
```

On all nodes the following ports are available:

- **4200**: HTTP port for access to the admin interface through your web browser
- **4300**: inter-node communication port
- **5432**: Postgres protocol communication port for connecting clients

### Notes

- CrateDB has a _lot_ of configuration. This package has been designed to minimise the amount of configuration that needs to be adjusted by the administrator.
- The configuration for this plan has been written so that the lead Habitat supervisor will always been the CrateDB master node.
