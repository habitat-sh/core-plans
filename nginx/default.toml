 # For help with NGINX Config Tuning,
 # refer to: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html


#### General Configuration
# worker_processes: Number of NGINX processes. Default = 1
worker_processes = 4

#### Simple Redirector Configuration
# redirector: If set, bypass normal config and just redirect http to https for all requests.
# redirector = true
#### Advanced Redirect Configuration
# If redirect_site is unset, this does nothing.
# If set, a server entry is created for each server_name which will 301 to the target_url
# If ssl_cert path is set, ssl_cert_key must also be set. Required if listen config includes "ssl".
# The path will be relative to the config directory
# You may create multiple [[redirect_site]] entries to redirect multiple sites
# (This is a toml array of tables)
#[[redirect_site]]
#server_name = "somehost.somedomain.com"
#listen = "443 ssl"
#ssl_cert = "somehost.somedomain.crt"
#ssl_cert_key = "somehost.somedomain.key"
#target_url = "https://someothersite.someotherdomain.org"

#### Events Context Configuration
[events]
# worker_connections: Connections per Worker Process.  Default = 1024
worker_connections = 1024

# http.sendfile: Enable (on) or disable (off) Sendfile Support.  Default = on
sendfile = "on"
