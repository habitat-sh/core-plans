# Concourse
The concourse plan _only_ provides users access to the standalone [concourse binary](https://concourse.ci/binaries.html). It is provided with the intention that any user's who need to run concourse will write their own plan that depends on this package and provide their own runtime management.

Concourse is a complex piece of software with multiple ways in which it can be configured to run. As such we provide this package to enable you to wrap and automate your preferred deployment style.
