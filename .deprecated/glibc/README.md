# glibc

  The GNU C Library project provides the core libraries for the GNU system and GNU/Linux systems,
  as well as many other systems that use Linux as the kernel. These libraries provide critical
  APIs including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, BSD, OS-specific APIs and more. These APIs include such
  foundational facilities as open, read, write, malloc, printf, getaddrinfo, dlopen,
  pthread_create, crypt, login, exit and more.
