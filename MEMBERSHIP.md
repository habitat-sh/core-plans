The core origin is the centrepiece of our ability to build and deploy

## Contributor

We welcome anyone to contribute Pull Requests to plans, write new plans, and review Pull Requests.

## Owner

An owner is the primary maintainer of an individual plan. A plan can have any number of owners, and an owner can step down at any time. It is the owner's responsibility to review and approve Pull Requests for a plan, to review issues related to a plan, and to mentor contributors working on the plan.

When a new plan is accepted, the submitter of the plan becomes its first owner. They are then welcome to recruit other owners or to step down as usual.

## Maintainer

A maintainer is an experienced plan author who has review privileges on every core plan. It is the responsibility of a maintainer to be the reviewer of last resort of a Pull Request - ensuring that PRs still get reviewed and merged even in the absence of an owner for that plan.

Maintainers should help to establish standards, contribute to code review tooling, and ensure that the long term health of the origin is maintained.
