# Community Membership

The core origin is the centrepiece of our ability to build and deploy
secure, maintainable applications. There are various types of ways to
help maintain the set of core plans.

| Role | Responsibilities | Requirements |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| contributor | Submitting PRs to plans |  |
| owner | Maintainer of one (or more) plans | Nominated by maintainers
or other owners |
| maintainer | Oversight of the whole repository | Experienced owner |

## Contributor

We welcome anyone to contribute Pull Requests to plans, write new plans, and
 review Pull Requests. 
Contributors abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
and be familiar with our [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) document.

## Owner

An owner is the primary maintainer of an individual plan. A plan can
have any number of owners, and an owner can step down at any time. It is
the owner's responsibility to review and approve Pull Requests for a
plan, to review issues related to a plan, and to mentor contributors
working on the plan.

When a new plan is accepted, the submitter of the plan becomes it's
first owner. They are then welcome to recruit other owners or to step
down as usual.

## Maintainer

A maintainer is an experienced plan author who has review privileges on
every core plan. It is the responsibility of a maintainer to be the
reviewer of last resort of a Pull Request - ensuring that PRs still get
reviewed and merged even in the absence of an owner for that plan.

Maintainers should help to establish standards, contribute to code
review tooling, and ensure that the long term health of the origin is
maintained.
