The Habitat Maintainers <humans@habitat.sh>

Builds a set of Plans and maintains a lightweight database so the same input
set can be resumed to make forward progress.

USAGE:
    $program [FLAGS] [<INPUT_FILE>]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information

ARGS:
    <INPUT_FILE>     A file containing a directory path containing a plan.sh
                     with one entry per line. When argument is not present,
                     input is read on standard in.

}

# **Internal** Handles exiting the program on signals. Takes either an argument
# with the status code, or uses the last command's status code.
#
# For example, the following would both exit with a status of 1:
#
# ```bash
# _on_exit 1
# ```
#
# Or:
#
# ```bash
# false
# _on_exit
# ```

# Executes a build on a Plan, assuming that it has not already been built by a
# previous execution of this program. A very simple, plaintext database is
# maintained to track every Plan that has successfully completed so that if a
# Plan in the middle fails, a developer need only fix the failing Plan, and
# re-run the program--not needed to start from sqaure one. The database is
# `tmp/build-plans.db` by default so deleting this file simply removes its
# build "memory".
