# PostgreSQL

This PostgreSQL plan supports standalone and clustered modes as well as continuous archiving via wal-e integration.

*NOTE:* The current version of this plan is an intterim version of the package that cannot be considered production ready. It can be used however archiving (by default) copies data in `{{pkg.svc_path}}/archive` which cannot be guaranteed as persisted between failures. That being said, the archive location is tunable in the default.toml.

## Standalone

To run a standalone PostgreSQL instance simply run
```
hab start core/postgresql
```
or
```
docker run starkandwayne/postgresql
```
if you want to bring up the pre-exported docker image.

## Cluster

This plan supports running clustered PostgreSQL by utilizing Habitat's native leader election.

You can run an example cluster via docker-compose after exporting a docker container from this plan:
```
$ hab pkg export docker core/postgresql
```

The docker post-process should create a docker image named `core/postgresql` and it should be available on your local machine

```
cat <<EOF > docker-compose.yml
version: '3'

services:
  pg1:
    image: core/postgresql
    command: "start core/postgresql --group cluster --topology leader"
  pg2:
    image: core/postgresql
    command: "start core/postgresql --group cluster --topology leader --peer pg1"
  pg3:
    image: core/postgresql
    command: "start core/postgresql --group cluster --topology leader --peer pg1"
EOF

docker-compose up
```

We intend to support a prod ready clustering solution similar to [patroni](https://github.com/zalando/patroni) and are working on getting there quickly.


## Binding

Consuming services can bind to PostgreSQL via:

```
hab start <origin>/<app> --bind database:postgresql.default --peer <pg-host>
```

Superuser access is exposed to consumers when binding and we advise that required databases, schemas and roles be created and migrations get run in the init hook of the consuming service. The created roles (with restricted access) should then be exposed to the application code that will get run.

To support binding to either standalone or custered PostgreSQL services we suggest using the `.first` field of the binding in the handlebars interpolation:
```
{{#with bind.database.first as |pg| ~}}
PGPASSWORD={{pg.cfg.superuser_password}}
PGUSER={{pg.cfg.superuser_name}}
PGHOST={{pg.sys.ip}}
{{/with ~}}
```

`.first` will always point to the leader when present.
