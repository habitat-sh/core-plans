Each commit must include a DCO which looks like this

`Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>`

The project requires that the name used is your real name.  Neither anonymous contributors nor those
utilizing pseudonyms will be accepted.

Git makes it easy to add this line to your commit messages.

1. Make sure the `user.name` and `user.email` are set in your git configs.
2. Use `-s` or `--signoff` to add the Signed-off-by line to the end of the commit message.
