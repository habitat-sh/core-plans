## Type of Package

Binary package

### Use as Dependency

Binary packages can be set as runtime or build time dependencies. See [Defining your dependencies](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/developing-packages/developing-packages/#sts=Define%20Your%20Dependencies) for more information.

To add core/PKG as a depdendency, you can add one of the following to your plan file.

##### Buildtime Dependency

> pkg_build_deps=(core/PKG)

##### Runtime Depdendency

> pkg_deps=(core/PKG)

### Use as Tool

#### Installation

To install this plan, you should run the following commands to first install, and then link the binaries this plan creates.

`hab pkg install core/PKG`

> 

`hab pkg binlink core/PKG`

> 

#### Using an example binary
You can now use the binary as normal:

`/bin/BINARY --help` or `BINARY --help`

```

```
