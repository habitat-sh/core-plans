# openssl

OpenSSL is an open source project that provides a robust, commercial-grade, and full-featured toolkit for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols. It is also a general-purpose cryptography library.

## Base Plans

This section outlines a general playbook for maintainers who are building this plan.

As a base plan, this plan has extra considerations when merging PRs and building the plan. This base plan can safely be built without a core plans base refresh.

1. The following plans must be verified as successfully building, along with success of any automated tests, before merging any PRs:

```
core-plans/openssl
core-plans/openssl-musl/
habitat/components/hab/
core-plans/libarchive
habitat/components/sup
core-plans/curl
core-plans/postgresql
builder/components/builder-api
```

It is important to verify each of these packages because Habitat is a self-hosting system. In other words, `hab` is used to build `core-plans` and `core-plans` is used to build `hab`. We need to perform this extra level of verification to ensure that a change in a base plan does not prevent the ability to ship new packages.

1. Once the plan is merged, make a tracking issue on Github to document the work post merging the PR. This tracking issue should look something like: https://github.com/habitat-sh/core-plans/issues/2339

1. You must verify that all upstream plans can build successfully in `unstable`. Habitat Builder will kick off any builds as soon as the PR is merged. These builds should take around 5 hours to complete. You can monitor with this:

```
hab bldr job status -o core
```

```

```

1. Make a list of any failed builds and investigate any failures. At this point you will want to document issues with failures, or if the failures are transient, note them as such in the tracking issue.

1. At this point you can make a determination if any of the issues above are blocking promotion. You will want to block promotion if failed builds caused other core plans to become `Skipped`, but may also want to block based on other issues.

1. If you are not blocked from promoting, now you will want to promote the base plan package (in this case `openssl`).

1. Now you will want to interactively promote upstream packages. You can do this with:

```
hab bldr job promote <group_number> stable -o core -i
```

Where <number> is the job number.

Remove any packages with `hab` in the name. DO NOT PROMOTE ANYTHING WITH `hab` in the name!

1. Now you will need to do this for each job group. Note that there is currently a Builder API bug where Windows packages will return an error:

```
XXX
XXX Failed to promote job group: APIError(NotFound, "")
XXX
```

These will have to be promoted in the UI separately.

1. Finally, you will want to track and rebuild any packages that Failed during the build after you merged the PR. Rebuild any packages, regardless if they have known build issues or were transient failures.

1. Add any documentation that you learned during the process.

1. Close the tracking issue.
